## Note

- This template is a Maven project with zero dependencies to [keep it simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). 
- All task input files ([src/main/resources](src/main/resources)) are excluded from the repository with `.gitignore` – we should not post them publicly, as Eric Wastl asks for: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081).
